# Avian Influenza Agent-Based Simulation

This project was created for the **Computational Modelling** unit at UWA.

It simulates the spread of **low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)** in poultry farms using an **agent-based model (ABM)** implemented in Python. The simulation explores the impact of environmental factors such as **temperature** and **hygiene** on the transmission dynamics of avian influenza.
